- In analysis of algorithms, probabilistic analysis of algorithms is an approach to estimate the computational complexity of an algorithm or a computational problem.
- It starts from an assumption about a probabilistic distribution of the set of all possible inputs.
- This assumption is then used to design an efficient algorithm or to derive the complexity of a known algorithm.
- In probabilistic analysis of probabilistic (randomized) algorithms, the distributions or average of all possible choices in randomized steps is also taken into account, 
in addition to the input distributions.
